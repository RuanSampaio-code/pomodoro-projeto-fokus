# pomodoro-projeto-fokus
Project is inspired by the Pomodoro technique. This project was based in course 'JavaScript: manipulando o DOM' by alura.

Aims to focus on important tasks. In this way, we concentrate on one activity for 25 minutes, for example, and after that period, it's possible to take a 5-minute break or opt for a longer 15-minute break.

Note that when clicking on "Short Break," several elements on the screen undergo changes: the phrase located to the left and above the timer, the image of the person on the right, as well as the background color.

Furthermore, when choosing "Start" on the timer, the button's style is modified, an audio is activated, and the timer is started. When opting for "Pause," another audio is triggered, and the timer is effectively paused.
